    "**Clustering** is the task of identifying similar instances and assigning them to clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer segmentation**: clustering customers based on purchases and activity, and adapt products and marketing to each segment. Useful for recommender systems.\n",
    "- **Data analysis**: clustering instances based on feature relationships. Useful for gaining early insights and separating the data.\n",
    "- **Dimensionality reduction**: after clustering a dataset, each instance can be redefined according to its affinity with each cluster, reducing dimensionality to the (much lower) number of clusters while preserving most of the information.\n",
    "- **Anomaly detection**: identifying instances with low cluster affinities to detect outliers.\n",
    "- **Semi-supervised learning**: clustering a partially-labeled dataset, and then propagating the labels to like-instances for a subsequent supervised training stage.\n",
    "- **Search engines**: clustering a collection of images, then returning the best-matching cluster when a reference image is provided.\n",
    "- **Image segmentation**: clustering pixels according to color, then replacing each with its cluster's mean color. Useful for object and contour detection, tracking systems."
